# Welcome to my profile ✌

## ⚡ Skills
- 💻 **Core Tools**: **Java** (Back-end) and **Ruby on Rails** (for the love of fast web dev).
- 🛠️ **Fullstack Focus**: Building robust backends and clean web interfaces.
- 🔥 **Interested in**: Scalable Architecture, Ruby Ecosystem, and Backend optimization.

## 📈 Works
In addition to full-featured development, with over ten years of experience working in the Minecraft ecosystem, I specialize in the architecture of high-performance SMP (Server Multiplayer) and Vanilla-like environments. My approach focuses on strategic scaling: identifying highly effective tools and accurately determining when to abandon outdated methods or ineffective approaches to maintain system integrity. My technical knowledge and architectural solutions are backed by concrete, fact-based results from real-world scenarios, and I can provide specific evidence of my impact upon request.

From early 2023 to the present, I have been successfully collaborating with major Russian media personalities such as [bratishkinoff](https://www.twitch.tv/bratishkinoff), [drakeoffc](https://www.twitch.tv/drakeoffc), [GwinGlade](https://www.twitch.tv/drakeoffc) and others, ensuring the technical stability of their platforms during high-traffic events. Starting in 2026, I am open to new professional opportunities. Although my primary specialization is SMP, I am ready to apply my systematic approach and proven technical experience to other game modes or complex backend tasks that require mature development.

I have been working for the company as an infrastructure developer on the Ruby on Rails framework for over a year and a half.

_All repositories older than 2026 are a dump that is too lazy to clean up. New projects have not been published yet for some non-obvious reasons._
